          <span><p>Length: 4.18 km, one way.<br />Elevation change: Trailhead at 2084 m (484 m gain). <br />Trailhead: Located at Madison Junction, about 0.48 km north of the junction on the Madison-Norris Road. The trailhead begins at the barricade on the west side of the road, where there is a small turnout for parking.</p>
<p>Most hikers staying at Madison Campground can approach the trailhead on foot by hiking past the campground entrance station, crossing the road, and following a path to the Park Service employee-housing area. From there, roughly follow the road east, and route-find through the development to the trailhead.</p>
<p>Following the highway also is possible, but heavy traffic and narrow shoulders make the highway hazardous for hikers. The trailhead starts at the western edge of a Gibbon River meadow, and the area generally is saturated by springs at the foot of the mountain and run off from nearby thermal Terrace Spring. Once into the trees, the trail begins a steep ascent of Purple Mountain (2570 m). From halfway up to the roundish summit are excellent views of the surrounding landscape, visible through thin stands of trees. Just to the south is National Park Mountain, which is part of the southern rim of Madison Canyon. Beyond the rim is the relatively level but undulating and extensive Madison Plateau. It was here during mid-August of 1988 that the man-caused Northfork Fire raced across the plateau and burned Purple Mountain. Campers staying in Madison Campground were not given adequate notice of the advancing threat. As the fire approached, most campers were out sight-seeing and, upon their return, were cut off and unable to claim their possessions for several days. Luckily, nobody was trapped or injured in the blaze. The extensive burn can be seen on the plateau. Purple Mountain, and Gibbon and Madison valleys. Purple Mountain was named in 1904 by geologist Arnold Hague, probably for weathered outcroppings of rhyolitic welded ash.Length: 0.48 km, one way. Elevation change: Trailhead at 2069 m (36 m elevation). Trailhead: Located on the north side of the West Entrance Road, 3 km west of Madison Junction. The trailhead is not well-marked, but on the opposite side of the road is a visitor turnout that overlooks the Madison River. This is a short, enjoyable hike for campers staying at Madison Campground. The trail wanders through lodgepole pine that burned in the 1988 fires to a IO-acre lake that is rimmed with cattails, rushes and yellow pond-lily pads. Harlequin Lake was known as "Secret Lake" during the late 1940s and 50s because of its secluded location near the road. At that time, trumpeter swans were frequent nesters at the lake but in 1958, the lake was named after the colorful duck. On the northern edge is a beaver lodge, and elk frequent this lake in the early summer and fall as well. But the lake itself is considered barren of fish. It is between 1 and 3 m deep, and most of the lake freezes during winter.</p></span>
